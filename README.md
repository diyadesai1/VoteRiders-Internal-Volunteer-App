# What this website does

This website turns a basic list of URLs into an organized, browsable catalog. Resources are presented as clean, consistent cards with clear titles and descriptions, making it faster to scan, search, and open what you need on any device.

## Advantages over a plain list of links

- Better scannability: readable titles, descriptions, and icons improve recognition and reduce hunting.
- Organization: group by category or tags; sort and filter to surface the right items quickly.
- Discoverability: search helps find items by name, topic, or keywords.
- Context: show metadata (e.g., source, type) so users know what they’ll get before clicking.
- Usability: consistent “open in new tab,” copy-link actions, and keyboard navigation improve speed.
- Accessibility: structured markup and focus management make navigation easier for all users.
- Performance: snappy client-side navigation and caching make the UI feel fast compared to reloading pages.
- Safety: normalized external links (e.g., noreferrer/noopener) reduce common security pitfalls.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
